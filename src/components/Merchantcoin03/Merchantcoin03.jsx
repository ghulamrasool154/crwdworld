              <h2>Index Fund Performance:</h2>
              <p>
                On our Blockchain Ecosystem, a Merchant Coin provides a way to
                track the performance of the markets by dedicating a single
                merchant coin to a sub-industry of the Global Industrial
                Categorization Standard (GICS).
                <br />
                <br />
                GICS is traditionally a system for categorizing every public
                company by economic sector and industry group. It is used by
                investors, analysts, and economists to compare competing
                companies.
                <br />
                <br />
                Everyone wants a decent return (usually without too much risk).
                In traditional non-digital markets, index funds have
                consistently beaten the average managed fund. They solve the
                challenge in investing, which is deciding where to invest money.
                <br />

                While thousands of cryptocurrencies exist on other non-regulated
                blockchains, these markets expose investors to dangerous risks.
