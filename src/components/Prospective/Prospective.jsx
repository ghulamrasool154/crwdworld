              <p>Vogon is a decentralized cloud and blockchain platform</p>
              <p>
              The vogonAg Token will be a hybrid utility token and a foundation for Vogon utility transactions and for equity tokens and merchant coins designed to function as a transaction processor for both API calls and financial settlements within the CrowdPoint ecosystem

              </p>
              <p>
              vogonAg Tokens will be commodity-backed (i.e., silver) tokens that have instant settlement time, custodianship in a U.S. chartered bank, and circulation via a CFTC-registered Central Counterparty Clearinghouse

              </p>
              <p>
              vogonAg Tokens will be fully collateralized by silver streamer agreements purchased from reputable silver mines  

              </p>
              <p>
              vogonAg Tokens will be modeled as Forward Claims or Swap Contracts – and therefore subject to CFTC regulation as a Utility Token. 

              </p>

                Investors will experience accretive benefits as more users adopt
                Vogon / CrowdPoint; this will be due to speculation of the
                growth potential of vogonAg

              <p>
              No – vogonAg will have
              consumptive use qualities .

              </b>
              <p>
              No – Since vogonAg uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, it uses validators vs. miners to operate the Blockchain.

              <ul>
                <li>
                vogonAg will be used to purchase Merchant Coins within the CrowdPoint Ecosystem. Merchant Coins will be used to purchase security tokens

                We then leverage AI to optimize the mean ratio of the signal
                output of a Merchant Coin as both a forecast and a sub-industry
                index. This approach will correctly make predictions for any
                near or long-term horizons: The gain value based on a new Alpha,
                the utility of worth, speculation, and scarcity.

                <br />
             Unlike the vogonAg tokens, Merchant coins are expressed as
                fractionalized grams of Silver. The signal input of the Coin's
                stochastic value expressed as Silver is described as
                fractionalized 0.999 grams of Silver.
                <br />
                <br /> This approach is repeated at a logarithmic scale across
                Exchanges in terms of the decimal algorithm of the same ratio
                expressed between Merchant Coins.
