                In 1889, Friedrich von Wieser asserted in his book "The
                Elementary Theory of Value" that the highest principle of all
                economies is utility. The utility is imperfectly contained in
                value. The amount of utility contained is intimately associated
                with the idea of goods. Where value and utility come into
                conflict, utility must conquer; nothing in the nature of value
                could give it the ascendency{" "}

                CrowdPoint is defining the next era in finance. We are building
                a Blockchain Ecosystem. A blockchain ecosystem is a network of
                participants in a blockchain that share business objectives and
                processes. Today, the Business ecosystems run by big technology
                companies extract value for themselves. In our blockchain
                ecosystem, everyone extracts value.
                <br />
                The heart of the Blockchain Exchange is the data about the
                digital version of you. Your data is the basis for all eCommerce
                in the digital domain. It allows you to secure privacy, protects
                you from identity theft, and improves your financial performance
                on the Blockchain. In the Blockchain Ecosystem, your
                Decentralized iD (crwdid) has both "bullion" and numismatic"
                value based on your data's volume, velocity, variety, and
                veracity. 
                <br />
                <br />
                At CrowdPoint, we offer a clear market differentiator in our
                technology. It redefines decentralized, distributed, and
                blockchain database technology. We built an entirely new
                approach to creating a distributed cloud because 
                <br />
                <br />
                There were a lot of problems with existing blockchains,
                everything from multimedia transactions to multi-hour
                transactions, as is sometimes the case with current high-power
                consumption blockchains with an inferior ability to interact in
                any enterprise setting.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our open public distributed cloud architecture includes a
                blockchain offering guest languages that allow for more
                efficient and effective smart contracts. It provides a freely
                competitive market where any buyer or seller may trade, and
                competition determines prices. Our Blockchain Ecosystem is an
                assembly of hyper-effective FinTech Companies that derive
                exponential efficiencies through sharing a meta and unified
                Blockchain protocol organized into 11 Market Sectors, 24
                Industry Groups, 69 Industries, and 159 sub-industries.  
                <br />
                Each subindustry leverages its own digital currency that acts as
                a better version of a Petro dollar backed by tokenized
                instruments yielding an excess return.
