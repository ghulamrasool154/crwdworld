                  A Merchant Coin Index is a market capitalization- <br />
                  weighted      index based on five factors:
                </b>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    First, The floor value is determined by the number of
                    utility tokens held in the Merchant Coin reserve.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Second, it is based on the combined asset value in all the
                    purchased security tokens offered by Companies that have
                    participated in a Direct Public Offering. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Third, it is based on the total authorized and currently
                    issued.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Fourth, it is based on the performance of the subindustry
                    measured by an enhanced Sharpe ratio that is the current
                    market activity transactions (corporate buying and selling)
                    on the Blockchain divided by the S&P sector equivalent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Finally, the fifth factor is the number of consumers,
                    investors, and companies on our Blockchain that have
                    expressed or demonstrated interest in participating in the
                    sub-industry.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Because our Merchant Coins are based on these five metrics, it
                  is widely accepted as a benchmark for the strength or weakness
                  of the broader blockchain ecosystem market. Because the
                  underlying security tokens tied to each sub-industry often
                  move up or down in tandem, it isn't unusual for this index to
                  make decisive moves in either direction.

                    .As an investment asset, a security token is a digital asset
                    that represents certain rights and transfers value from an
                    asset or bundle of assets to a token. In plain language,
                    security tokens are the digital form of traditional
                    investments like stocks, bonds, or other securitized assets.{" "}
                    <br /> <br />
                    <strong>
                      There are several advantages to the use of Index tokens as
                      a financial instrument for a sub-industry: <br /> <br />
                    </strong>
                    The Index Token has many attributes of a traditional
                    exchange-traded note (ETN). It is essentially a loan
                    instrument issued by Ecosystem bank. It comes with a set
                    maturity period and can be traded based on demand and
                    supply. <br />
                    <br />
                    The gains or losses of the investor are derived from the
                    performance of this asset class that acts as a sub-industry
                    index.. They are a type of bond that pays the returns of the
                    index that it tracks at maturity. However, Index Tokens do
                    not pay interest as bonds do.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    When the Index Tokens) mature, the financial institution
                    offers the investor cash in an amount that reflects the
                    underlying index’s performance.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As security tokens trade, the investors can sell and buy the
                    notes and make money from the gap between buying and selling
                    rates, deducting any fees.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Index Tokens do not give holders control of the assets but
                    merely pay the return that the index.
