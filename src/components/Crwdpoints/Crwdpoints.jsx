                    A crwdpoint is issued by a merchant and the name is
                    registered on crwdfinance.

                    <br />
                    Personalized crwdpoints are assets that act like a special
                    class of stock that acts like a negotiable bond.

                    The tokens are trackable, verifiable and are backed by
                    Utility Tokens accessed by both customers and vendors. They
                    are secure and eliminate all the friction existing in the
                    traditional coupon ecosystem.

                    <br />
                    This global coupon capacity environment is trust-less and
                    permission-less and allows additional actors in the process;
                    brands, users, and publishers. Brands shall be able to
                    release less expensive coupon tokens based on excess
                    capacity that are also easy to track and cannot be redeemed
                    multiple numbers of times.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is a compelling solution as in the US alone, Almost 90%
                    of consumers used coupons in 2020. Over half of consumers
                    prefer getting coupons and discounts on their mobile
                    devices.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Over 142 million US adults redeemed digital coupons in 2020.
                    68% of consumers believe that digital coupons generate
                    loyalty.

                    <br />
                    crwdworld will issue a capacity coupon token, CCT, purchased
                    using the Vogon Utility Token. Merchants propose the price
                    per token and are released through crwdmarkets to as many
                    users as possible.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The merchants sell excess capacity on days they might need
                    revenue most. Customers purchase those tokens through the
                    use of Utility Tokens.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The tokens are converted into Merchant Coins aligned with
                    the sub-industry providing a stable index.

                The Merchant Coins are digital currencies designed to maintain a
                direct one-to-one peg to a more stable underlying asset, like
                the vogonAg. The merchants can redeem those merchant coins by
                selling them or incentivizing employees and their vendors. The
                Merchant Coins are designed to provide stable value and as a
                store of value and medium of exchange.
                <br />
                <br />
                They minimize volatility by maintaining collateral in the form
                of reserves of vogonAg, and provide steady value.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Merchant Coins can contribute to the value of the ecosystem
                through lending and investing, in a manner similar to
                traditional banks.
                <br />
                <br />
                Investors are able to speculate on the volume of Merchant coins
                used by the sub-industry.
                <br />
                <br />
                Merchant Coins tied to silver utility-backed tokens become the
                most important financing tools for merchants worldwide as they
                are redeemed before a product is shipped or services rendered.
                crwdworld takes a percentage% fee.
                <br />
                <br />
                The initial number of crwdpoints tokens will be allocated at 500
                million of an available 1 billion. As each vendor will be given
                an allocation for them to label, the remaining will stay in
                escrow, awaiting redistribution for the platform's best
                interest.
